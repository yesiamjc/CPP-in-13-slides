/*The datatypes of C++ are mainly :

short            |    float          |     string
int              |    double         |
long             |    long double    |
long long        |                   |

The variables are mainly symbolic such as a,b,c etc where the values are contained
camelCase Notation : 
if you name a variable as marksInMath and assign value for it then in later half 
writting only mim will suggest the variable this is called camelCase Notation.
Caautions of variable rules : 
Do not use same variable name twice 
to assign a constant value to a varriavle write int const variable name  = assigned value; and the value will 
be constant 
variable name can be letters and underscore
